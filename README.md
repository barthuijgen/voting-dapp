# Election dApp tutorial

This repository contains the code files used in the
[Election dApp tutorial](https://docs.kadena.io/build/guides/building-a-voting-dapp).

## Repository structure

The repository is broken down into the following directories:

- `pact`, which holds the smart contracts which are also deployed on testnet chain 0
- `frontend`, which holds a basic react application which forms the frontend part of our application
- `snippets`, which holds code snippets to facilitate deployment of our smart contracts to testnet and mainnet

See the tutorial for a detailed description on the contents of each of these folders.
